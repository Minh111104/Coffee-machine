## Modules

### `coffee_maker.py`
Manages the coffee machine's resources. It checks if there are enough ingredients for the selected drink and deducts resources when a drink is made.

### `main.py`
Acts as the main driver of the application. It continuously prompts the user for their choice and coordinates the interaction between the coffee maker, menu, and payment systems.

### `menu.py`
Contains the `Menu` and `MenuItem` classes, which define the available drinks and their required ingredients.

### `money_machine.py`
Handles the coin processing and payment system. It calculates the total amount of coins entered and checks if the payment is sufficient for the chosen drink.
